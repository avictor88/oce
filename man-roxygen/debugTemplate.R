#' @param debug an integer specifying whether debugging information is
#' to be printed during the processing. This is a general parameter that
#' is used by many `oce` functions. Generally, setting `debug=0`
#' turns off the printing, while higher values suggest that more information
#' be printed. If one function calls another, it usually reduces the value of
#' `debug` first, so that a user can often obtain deeper debugging
#' by specifying higher `debug` values.
