#' @param debug an integer specifying whether debugging information is
#' to be printed during the processing. This is a general parameter that
#' is used by many `oce` functions. Generally, setting `debug=0`
#' turns off the printing, while higher values suggest that more information
#' be printed. If `debug` is not supplied, it defaults to
#' [`getOption`]`("oceDebug")`.
