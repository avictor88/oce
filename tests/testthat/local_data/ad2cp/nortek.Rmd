title: Confusion over an AD2CP file
date: 2022-08-12

This is mainly a message to R.E., but I will CC it to others in this discussion
of decoding Nortek AD2CP files in the R package called "oce". I am looking
again at the ad2cp file that I sent before (attached again, for completeness).

I am confused as to why you (R.E.) say

> I could not find any sequences of a5 0c 23 in the attached .ad2cp file.

because I see that sequence when examining the file in two different ways. I'll
show the two methods in the next sections.

# Examining the file in R

The R code
```
    buf <- readBin("ad2cp_01.ad2cp", "raw", n=1e6)
```

reads the file (it's 50,000 bytes, but I ask for a million to be sure to get to the end).  Then I look at two spots in the file: (a) the start and (b) at byte 6997.

## Start of file

The R code
```
	buf[1:10]
```
gives output
```
	a5 0a a0 10 f2 11 f6 8f b9 72
```
which we may read directly (i.e. the R function readBin() reads the bytes as they are, without alternating for the endianness of the machine)

* 0xa5: sync char
* 0x0a = decimal 10: number of bytes in the header
* 0xa0 = decimal 160: ID code, meaning that this is a text sequence

and this makes sense, as this first data chunk holds the instrument-setup commands.

## Partway through file

The R code
```
	buf[6996 + 1:12]
```
gives output
```
	a5 0c 23 10 a0 3e 00 00 92 24 86 35
```
which I read as

* 0xa5: sync char
* 0x0c=decimal 12: number of bytes in the header
* 0x23: ID code that is undocumented in the 2022 manual, but which I am told is a code that will be used in future systems.  (This data file may be from a test instrument.)

# Using "od" command to see file contents

I am on an intel-based mac, and so "od" emits bytes in flipped order.  Again, we look at two spots

## Start of file

Using the unix command
```
	od -j 0 -N 10 -A d -vx ad2cp_01.ad2cp
```
yields
```
	0000000      0aa5    10a0    11f2    8ff6    72b9
```

Here, the first value is a decimal counter, and after that are the bytes (in reversed order within each 4-character unit).  I read this as

* 0xa5 = sync char
* 0x0a = decimal 10 = number of bytes in header
* 0xa0 = ID for a string record (which holds the instrument-setup header)

In other words, I get the same interpretation with "od" as I get R.

## Partway through file

Using
```
	od -j 6996  -N 10 -A d -vx ad2cp_01.ad2cp
```
reveals
```
	0006996      0ca5    1023    3ea0    0000    2492
```
which, as above, yields

* 0xa5: sync char
* 0x0c=decimal 12: number of bytes in header
* 0x23: unknown ID, as above

## Commentary

Using two different methods, I get the byte sequence a5-0c-23 in this file. I
think this file may be from a test instrument, and that would make me think I
can ignore the format until it is documented, but I am confused as to why you
don't see the sequence.  I do not have a Windows machine so I don't know how to
suggest similar work there.
