The purpose of this listing is to help as I (slowly) move code from
unvectorized form to vectorized form.


# `S102791A002_Barrow_v2.ad2cp`

```{r}
library(oce)
d1 <- read.oce("S102791A002_Barrow_v2.ad2cp")
str(d1@data,2)
```


# `ad2cp_01.ad2cp`

```{r}
library(oce)
d1 <- read.oce("ad2cp_01.ad2cp")
str(d1@data,2)
```
