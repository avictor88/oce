**Contents of directory.** This document explains how the files in this
directory were created.  In many cases, the data are truncated using `dd`,
because the original files are too large to be stored on github.

**Instructions for adding to this directory.** 

1. Place entries in alphabetical order. Change the numbering of the headers, as
   required. Try to use file names that will have some meaning to a reader
doing a file listing. 

2. Put an entry in a `.R` file in the parent directory to read the file and
   test the resultant data in some useful way. The file name should be start
with `test_local`.  Some tests may involve comparison against a second source,
e.g. information provided by manufacturer's software or inferred by inspection
of the data file with an editor or other software.  It also very helpful to
have consistency checks to guard against changes to oce; these can be
constructed simply by reading in the data once, and creating a test that the
same results are obtained by rereading.

**How these file are used.** Simply adding a file here does nothing useful.

# 12. a broken ctd file

`CTD_98911_1P_1_DN.txt` is from an ODF file that CR had. It has p, temperature,
and theta, but no salinity or conductivity. It is worth testing because it's
odd, basically.

# 13. Nortek Signature adp file in ad2cp format

`ad2cp_01.ad2cp` is the first 20,000 bytes of a source file generously provided
by github user @krillthor, who started issue 1676 and provided tests that
helped greatly during the code improvements motivated by that issue.  It was
created with

```
head -c 50000 X.ad2cp > ad2cp_01.ad2cp
```

where `X.ad2cp` is a stand-in for the original file name.
