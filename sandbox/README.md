This directory is used by the developers, to explore ideas for oce enhancements
in full view of users. However, nothing stored here enters the oce package,
since this directory is named in the `.Rbuildignore` file.

Directories herein are usually named for github issues, so that e.g. the
directory named `1490` stores work related to issue 1490 (see
https://github.com/dankelley/oce/issues/1490).
