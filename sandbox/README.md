This directory is used by the developers, to explore ideas for oce enhancements
in full view of users. However, nothing stored here enters the oce package,
since this directory is named in the `.Rbuildignore` file.

Note that github 'actions' will be triggered by any changes done here, so please
do not use this spot as a place to work on issues or to try exploratory things;
use www.github.com/dankelley/oce-issues for the former, and branches for the
latter.
