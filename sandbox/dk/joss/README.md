I give up.  I tried maybe 20 tweaks (each with a git-push and 5 to 10 minute
wait) to get good breaks in the text.  I will instead now work with the .md
file that is created.  That means changing the workflow.  The old workflow and
old Rmd are here. Note that the latter is *not* the final product.  It is just
here for posterity.
