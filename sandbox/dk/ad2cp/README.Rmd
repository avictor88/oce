# echosounder and echosounderRaw

## 2022-09-04

I altered the distance formula.  I sort of think it's right but I am not sure I
understand RA/Nortek's formula (which, btw, contradicts EB/Nortek's formula).

Since I think a new manual is in the works, I will stop bothering Nortek on
this, and see if things are clearer in the new docs.

All I can say for now is that the echosounderRaw and echosounder results look quite similar now; see dek05.Rmd for a comparison.
