# Competing Nortek checksum schemes

Figures 1 and 2 show differing schemes for computing checksums, from References
1 and 2, respectively. Let's call these Method 1 and Method 2. (Unhelpfully,
the modern equivalent to Ref 1, that is, Ref 3, has no sample code.)

As shown in Figure 3, ref 2 provides sample data that can be used as a test. It
is used here as a test. Specifically, page 8 of ref 2 states that the checksum
of the sequence a5 21 4f 00 45 17 14 15 20 05 00 00 00 00 92 00 is b4e0.  The
endianness is unstated, but I tried both possibilities, and it is the second,
i.e. b2 below, not the b1 that is written in Ref 3.

# A test of Method 2

The file `checksum.c` (see Appendix 3) holds a version of the Nortek code
written to modern C standards (with specified-length types).    Running it on
the `b1` file (created with R code shown in Appendix 3) produced with R code as
above does not retrieve the same checksum as Nortek states, but using `b2`
yields agreement.  In other words, Nortek is (confusingly!) writing bytes in
little-endian order.

The output of `checksum b2` is as follows. The final value matches expectations
for the `b2` file, but not for `b1`. In other words, the Nortek manual is not
listing bytes in actual order, but rather in the order that would occur if you
read by little-endian 2-byte chunks.

```
./checksum b2
buf[0:15]: 0x21 0xa5 0x0 0x4f 0x17 0x45 0x15 0x14 0x5 0x20 0x0 0x0 0x0 0x0 0x0 0x92 
checksum(buffer, n=8)
 start with 0xb58c
 add 0xa521 to get 0x00015aad
 add 0x4f00 to get 0x0001a9ad
 add 0x4517 to get 0x0001eec4
 add 0x1415 to get 0x000202d9
 add 0x2005 to get 0x000222de
 add 0x0000 to get 0x000222de
 add 0x0000 to get 0x000222de
 add 0x9200 to get 0x0002b4de
computed checksum: 0xb4e0 (expect 0xb4e0)
```

# Appendix 3: C code to test checksums

`checksum.c`, based on method 2, follows

```C
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

short ChecksumORIG(short *phBuff, int n) {
    int i;
    short hChecksum = 0xb58c;
    for (i=0; i<n; i++)
        hChecksum += phBuff[i];
    return hChecksum;
}

// This follows the pattern of Page 79 of Ref 3, but with specified types, to
// avoid possibly problems porting the nortek code, which has unstated
// assumptions (on endianness, on the size of a 'short', etc.
int16_t nortek_checksum(uint16_t *phBuff, int n) {
    uint32_t hChecksum = 0xb58c; // I think this is large enough
    uint16_t res;
    printf("checksum(buffer, n=%d)\n", n);
    printf(" start with 0x%04x\n", hChecksum);
    for (int i=0; i<n; i++) {
        hChecksum += phBuff[i];
        printf(" add 0x%04x to get 0x%08x\n", phBuff[i], hChecksum);
    }
    res = hChecksum % 0xffff;
    return res;
}


int main(int argc, char **argv)
{
    FILE *in;
    int32_t len;
    unsigned char *buf;
    uint16_t *buf2;
    uint16_t cs2;
    if (argc != 2) {
        printf("ERROR: give a filename\n");
        exit(1);
    }
    in = fopen(argv[1], "rb");
    fseek(in, 0, SEEK_END);
    len = ftell(in);
    rewind(in);
    buf = (unsigned char*)malloc(len*sizeof(unsigned char));
    fread(buf, 1, len, in);
    printf("buf[0:%d]: ", len-1);
    for (int32_t i = 0; i < len; i++)
        printf("0x%x ", buf[i]);
    printf("\n");
    // read 2 bytes at a time
    rewind(in);
